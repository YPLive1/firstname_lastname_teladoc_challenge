BDD Automation Project
This project demonstrates automated testing using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles with Selenium WebDriver in Java.

Overview
The purpose of this project is to automate the testing of web tables functionality on the http://www.way2automation.com/angularjs-protractor/webtables/ website. It covers two scenarios:

Add a User: Automates the process of adding a user to the table and verifies if the user has been added successfully.
Delete a User: Automates the process of deleting a user from the table and verifies if the user has been deleted successfully.
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

src/main/java: Contains the main source code.
pages: Page object model (POM) classes for different web pages.
base: Base classes for WebDriver initialization and cleanup.
src/test/java: Contains the test code.
stepDefinitions: Cucumber step definitions for BDD scenarios.
src/test/resources: Contains feature files with Gherkin syntax for defining BDD scenarios.
Setup Instructions
To run the automated tests on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of this repository.

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine. If not, download and install them from the official websites.

Set Up WebDriver: Download the appropriate WebDriver executable (e.g., ChromeDriver) and update the BrowserFactory.java file in the base package with the correct path.

Run the Tests: Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following Maven command to execute the tests:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean test
Test Reports
